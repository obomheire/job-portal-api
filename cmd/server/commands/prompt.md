The update does not work as expected. When I send a request to update, I just want to send the fields that I want to update and the rest should remain the same, but now, it update the new field and set other fields to null/empty string. Also when I send a request with a new skill, it should be added into the array of the etisting field skills if skills array already exists rather than overwriting the existing skills array
